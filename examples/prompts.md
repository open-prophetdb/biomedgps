### Prompt 1
Knowledge Subgraph: {{subgraph}}\n\nKnowledge Subgraph Analysis Request:\n\nSubgraph Overview: I have compiled a Knowledge Subgraph dedicated to exploring the complex landscape surrounding {{disease_name}}, incorporating elements such as related symptoms, co-occurring diseases, therapeutic medications, and underlying genes/pathways. This Subgraph aims to elucidate:\n\nDisease-Symptom Associations: The linkages between symptoms of {{disease_name}} and their correlation with various diseases.\nMedication and Genetic/Pathway Connections: How medications align with and influence the genes or pathways associated with these diseases.\nMechanisms of Action: The specific pathways through which medications exert their therapeutic effects on these diseases.\nSymptom Detailing for {{disease_name}}: Specific symptoms related to {{disease_name}} include: {{symptoms}}.\nResearch Questions:\n\nIn light of the above, my queries are as follows:\n\nCritical Knowledge Identification: Within the context of {{disease_name}}, this Knowledge Subgraph houses an extensive array of entities and relationships fundamental to unraveling the disease's mechanisms and scrutinizing relevant treatment drugs. Leveraging your expertise, concentrate on the graph's relations pivotal to understanding {{disease_name}}'s mechanisms and its associated treatments. Identify and emphasize essential knowledge aspects that significantly aid in decoding the disease's pathology and therapeutic measures. This entails pinpointing vital biological pathways, gene-disease correlations, drug-target engagements, and any novel research insights that could reveal innovative therapeutic approaches. Your analysis is expected to prioritize data with a direct bearing on treatment efficacy and enhance our molecular-level understanding of the disease.\n\nEmerging Therapies: Are there any novel studies or predictive analyses indicating unrecognized medications that might benefit {{disease_name}} symptoms or the disease itself?\n\nSymptom-Disease Correlation: Which diseases are directly linked to {{disease_name}} symptoms, and what are the common treatments for these diseases?\n\nAction Mechanisms of Medications: How do these medications influence specific genes or pathways?\n\nGuidance for Response:\n\nPlease address the aforementioned inquiries based on the Knowledge Subgraph and your expertise. Where feasible, furnish related literature from PubMed, PMC, or other reputable sources to substantiate your responses. This approach ensures a thorough and evidence-based analysis of the Knowledge Subgraph, facilitating a comprehensive understanding of {{disease_name}} and its intricate web of symptoms, diseases, medications, and genetic/pathways.

### Prompt 2
Knowledge Subgraph: {{subgraph}}\n\nQuestions:\nI have a new Knowledge Subgraph focusing on {{disease_name}} that encompasses related symptoms, diseases, medications, and genes/pathways. This Subgraph might include: 1) associations between {{disease_name}} related symptoms and various diseases; 2) medications and genes/pathways related to these diseases; 3) how medications exert therapeutic effects through specific genes or pathways for these diseases. 4) {{disease_name}} related symptoms: {{symptoms}}. I am looking to understand:\n0) In the context of addressing a specific disease, such as {{disease_name}}, the Knowledge Subgraph contains a rich set of entities and relationships that are crucial for gaining a deeper understanding of the disease mechanisms and evaluating associated treatment drugs. Based on your knowledge, please focus on the relations within the Knowledge Graph that are pivotal for comprehending the mechanisms of {{disease_name}} and the drugs related to its treatment. Identify and highlight the key knowledge elements that contribute significantly to understanding the disease's pathology and therapeutic interventions. This includes pinpointing critical biological pathways, gene-disease associations, drug-target interactions, and any emerging research findings that could offer insight into novel therapeutic strategies. Your analysis should prioritize information that has a direct impact on disease treatment outcomes and advance our comprehension of the disease at a molecular level. \n1) if there are any new studies or predictive relationships indicating unrecognized medications that could be beneficial for {{disease_name}} symptoms or {{ disease_name }}.\n2) which diseases are directly associated with {{disease_name}} symptoms and the common treatment medications for these diseases.\n3) how these medications work by affecting certain genes or pathways.\n\nPlease answer the above questions according to the knowledge subgraph and your knowledges. If possible, you must provide the related literatures from PubMed, PMC, or other reliable sources to support your answers.
