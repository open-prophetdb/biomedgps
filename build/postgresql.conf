port = 5432                        # The default port PostgreSQL listens on

# - Memory -

shared_buffers = 4GB             # This setting depends on the total amount of RAM available on your machine. Usually, it's recommended to set it to 25% of total RAM for a dedicated PostgreSQL server.
work_mem = 4MB                     # This setting is per sort operation, not per connection. Be careful with this setting on busy systems.

# - Write Ahead Log -

# - Query/Index Tuning -

default_statistics_target = 100    # Higher values increase planning time, but can produce better plans. 
random_page_cost = 4.0             # The cost of a non-sequentially fetched disk page
effective_cache_size = 4GB         # An estimate of how much memory is available for disk caching by the operating system and within the database itself, after taking into account what's used by the OS itself and other applications.

# - AutoVacuum -

autovacuum = on                    # Enable autovacuum subprocess? 'on' or 'off'
