## Knowledge Graph

The RAPEX knowledge graph is a meticulously crafted resource designed to explore the toxicological mechanisms and health effects of air pollutants. It integrates data from 10 published databases and encompasses a wide range of biomedical knowledge, linking air pollution with symptoms, genes, diseases, proteins, pathways, and metabolites. The knowledge graph includes 12,857,601 knowledge points, providing a balanced and diverse distribution of relationships between entities. This extensive integration enables deep insights into the interactions between air pollution and biological systems.

## Curated Knowledges and Related Labeling Data

The curated knowledge dataset is derived from 865 rigorously selected publications, annotated and reviewed by at least two independent experts to ensure high quality and reliability. This dataset includes 1,134 distinct knowledge points categorized into 13 entity types and 12 relationship types. The curated knowledge and related labeling data are invaluable for validating knowledge extraction capabilities and predictive models of air pollution exposure mechanisms.
