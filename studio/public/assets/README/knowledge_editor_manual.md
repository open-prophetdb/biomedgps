Step 2. Find the academic literature you want to curate from. For example, if you want to curate information about ME/CFS, search the key words on PubMed.

Step 3. Upon choosing the paper of interest, read through the article and identify which piece of information can be curated into the knowledge graph. Network Medicine supports a two-node relationship type, so make sure the piece of knowledge has and only has two nodes.

An example here is adding the relationships between the disease Chronic Fatigue syndrome and the symptom orthostatic intolerance.

Step 4. Add two nodes into the knowledge graph editor. You need to identify the node type (e.g. gene, disease, symptom, etc.) from the dropdown menu first then select the node ID by searching the name of the node for both source node and target node.

Step 5. After adding both nodes, the relation type will generate automatically based on the types of two nodes so you can select the correct relation type from the dropdown menu. Add the PMID of the paper and a key sentence describing the relationships of these two nodes.
