## Introduction
1. Fill in the form to add a new edge to the graph. Each edge have two nodes, source and target. You should choose the type of the source and target node first, then search the node by ID or name. You need to choose the accurate node from the dropdown list. If you can't find the node, please use different ID or name to search again. <b>If you still can't find the node, please contact the administrator.</b>

2. After you choose the source and target node, you can fill in the other fields. <b>The fields with * are required. The fields with tooltip have more details.</b>

3. If you can find several knowledges from the literature, you need to add them one by one. After you submit the first knowledge, you can click the "Cancel" button to reset the form. Then you can add the next knowledge.

4. After you submit the knowledge, the administrator will review it. If the knowledge is valid, it will be added to the graph. If the knowledge is invalid, it will be improved by the administrator and then added to the graph. So the pmid is very important.

5. The key sentence can help the administrator to review the knowledge. So please fill in the key sentence as detailed as possible. You can find the key sentence from the literature and improve it if necessary. <b>Please make sure the key sentence is correct and human-readable. If there are pronouns in the key sentence, please replace them with the corresponding entities.</b>
