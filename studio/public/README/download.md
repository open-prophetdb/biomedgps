## Database Overview
Air pollution has emerged as the primary contributor to the global disease burden in 2021 and is recognized as the second leading risk factor for premature death worldwide. Among various pollutants, particulate matter (PM2.5) stands out as particularly harmful, posing health threats to 99% of the global population. Extensive research has linked long-term exposure to PM2.5 with serious health issues, including cancer and cardiovascular diseases. However, these studies often focus on the effects on individual diseases or specific health outcomes, lacking a systematic integration and multidimensional analysis. Traditional studies, which often isolate health outcomes without a broader, multidimensional approach, tend to focus solely on specific diseases. This deficiency underscores the importance of conducting integrated analyses of air pollution health impacts. Unfortunately, there is a notable absence of a comprehensive, integrated knowledge graph for detailed analysis, to better understand and mitigate the effects of air pollution.

Currently, there is a noticeable absence of comprehensive public knowledge resources available for systematically exploring the toxicological mechanisms and health effects of air pollutants. To address this gap, we aim to develop the RAPEX database, a knowledge graph-based system that integrates a broad spectrum of air pollutants and connects them with genes, proteins, pathways, diseases, and other multi-omics data. For the first time, RAPEX consolidates resources from approximately 20 public databases and gathers high-quality original data on the associations between air pollutants and genes and diseases from numerous publications. By pooling research findings from around the globe, RAPEX is poised to become an invaluable asset, providing comprehensive and up-to-date knowledge. This resource will facilitate a paradigm shift in air pollutant research, enabling users to easily query, compare, analyze, or predict potential relationships between air pollution and various diseases, thereby advancing the comprehensive exploration of the toxicological mechanisms of air pollutants.
